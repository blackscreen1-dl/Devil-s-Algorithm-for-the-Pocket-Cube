# Devil's Algorithm for the Pocket Cube

The Devil's Algorithm is defined as any sequence of moves (quarter turn metric) that when applied repeatedly, goes through every possible state of a rubik's cube. You can give a blindfolded person a scrambled rubik's cube and he will always be able to solve it applying the algorithm if someone says stops once it is solved.

The current upper bound of the Devil's algorithm on the 2x2x2 rubik's cube is 2886840. We will provide explicit construction for a significantly shorter Devil's algorithm for the 2x2x2 rubik's cube and prove stronger bounds for larger rubik's cubes.

To do:

- Finish making libraries to visualize rubik's cube
- Find God's number
- Find elements with maximal order
- Do TSP grouping permutations with same congruence classes wrt to the element with maximal order
